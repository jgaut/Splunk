 # This EXAMPLE script shows how to deploy the Splunk universal forwarder
 # to many remote hosts via ssh and common Unix commands.
 # For "real" use, this script needs ERROR DETECTION AND LOGGING!!
 
 # --Variables that you must set -----
 
 # Populate this file with a list of hosts that this script should install to,
 # with one host per line. This must be specified in the form that should
 # be used for the ssh login, ie. username@host
 #
 # Example file contents:
 # splunkuser@50.18.226.85
 # splunkker@50.18.226.29
 HOSTS_FILE="$HOME/whereToInstallUF"
 
 # This should be a WGET command that was *carefully* copied from splunk.com!!
 # Sign into splunk.com and go to the download page, then look for the wget
 # link near the top of the page (once you have selected your platform)
 # copy and paste your wget command between the ""
 WGET_CMD="wget -O splunkforwarder..."
 
 # Set the install file name to the name of the file that wget downloads
 # (the second argument to wget)
 INSTALL_FILE="splunkforwarder..."
 
 # After installation, the forwarder will become a deployment client of this
 # host.  Specify the host and management (not web) port of the deployment server
 # that will be managing these forwarder instances.
 DEPLOY_SERVER="xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8089"
 # Set the new Splunk admin password
 PASSWORD="newpassword"
 
 # ----------- End of user settings -----------
 
 # create script to run remotely. Watch out for line wraps, esp. in the "set deploy-poll" line below.
